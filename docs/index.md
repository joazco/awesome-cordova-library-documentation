## About the Project

In the wake of `@ionic-native` ceasing maintenance, a growing need was identified within the Cordova and Capacitor developer community for a replacement. This TypeScript library was created to fill that void, providing a robust and maintained solution for typing various plugins in a Cordova or Capacitor project.

## Why This Library?

The primary aim is to assist developers in benefiting from a smooth and type-safe development experience. With the power of TypeScript, this library offers:

- **Precise Typing**: Ensure you are utilizing your plugins correctly with compile-time type checks.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to seamlessly fit into any Cordova or Capacitor project.
- **Modularity**: Rather than being monolithic, the modular design allows developers to install only what they need.
